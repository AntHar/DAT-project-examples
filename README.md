## GA Data Science: Example Projects

This repo is a collection of example projects from students in General Assembly's part-time Data Science course. Rather than being a comprehensive collection of projects, its purpose is to give incoming GA Data Science students a sense of the variety and scope of past projects, and to spur their thinking for their own projects.
